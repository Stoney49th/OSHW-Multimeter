# OSHW-Multimeter

First steps towards a fully open source hardware multimeter. This is the main repository for the open source hardware multimeter, inspired by a thread at the [eevblog-website](http://www.eevblog.com/forum/oshw/open-source-multimeter/ "eevblog forum thread").
Since simple multimeters and old precision testgear isn't really that expensive anymore, this project will NOT offer a cheap/easy homebrew alternative to a bought off the shelf unit. It's purpose is to exercise the development of a precision mesurement unit and to document it's evolution so everybody can gain knownledge and have fun building one up :)


#### The project is currently in the prototype phase - schematic capture and PCB design will start soon in SVN over at [google code](https://code.google.com/p/oshw-multimeter/ "OSHW-Multimeter at Google Code"). Contributors are very welcome to join the process and discuss the schematics and the pcb layout. 


### Organization and File Tree

Every top-level directory starts with a 2 digit number XX followed by an underscore to show its position in the design process, eg. "01_High_Level_Requirements"
